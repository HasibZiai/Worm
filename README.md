# Worm

This project was an experiment to better understand malware and security practices.

The worm searches through a given list of credentials and attempts to propagate through the virtual network. 
It was tested on a series of virtual machines running a modified linux distribution provided by CSUF (Tuffix).

This was a class project for Spring 2020.
